# Airbnb Price Prediction
This project was an independent predictive project I completed during my studies in the Advanced Data Analytics for Management Support course, and it was rated 1.3. The main objective was to forecast property prices for Airbnb listings in London.

The task is solved by using both tabular data and text data. I applied data analysis pipelines, including data preparation and EDA, feature engineer, applying models, parameter tuning, and model evaluation. I applied different techniques in Natural Language Processing, including TF-IDF and word embedding. Furthermore, various deep learning models (Feedforward NN, RNN, CNN) and machine learning model(random forest)have been implemented.At last, we also compare the models in dimensions of training time, MSE, RMSE and MAE. 

Further details can be found in the notebook.
